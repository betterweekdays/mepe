            <p class="text-muted large">
                Aden Simone Coleman is from Prince George’s County, Maryland. She is a junior and currently pursuing her bachelor’s degree majoring in Business with a concentration in Marketing at the Illustrious Morgan State University, located in the inner city of East Baltimore, MD. Marketing is the balance of art and science that analyzes how people interact with products and messaging. The art is the packaging of the messages and channel selection; the science is understanding buyer behavior over time and the results of testing. It is the beauty of mastering that balance, with all of its moving parts, that draws her to pursue a career in Marketing. Upon graduation, she plans to work as a marketing manager at a tech company and eventually work full time running her own successful business as an entrepreneur and traveling the world speaking, teaching and sharing her knowledge. Aden first learned that she had a passion for business, and marketing after competing and winning against 24 teams in a Leaders of Tomorrow National MBA Association Harvard-level business case competition where she represented the Washington D.C Chapter as she analyzed Whole Foods. She was even elected 2017 President/CEO of her chapter and was chosen to represent them at the LeaderTech Tour in Silicon Valley where she was immersed in technology-based corporate environments like Facebook and Google. During her Sophomore year in college, she was one of the four international students and one of the two students from the U.S accepted into the Simon Nehme Entrepreneurship summer school (First Cohort) based in Ottawa, Canada. After the teams tested and designed a new startup, her team won first place in the school’s pitch competition. Since her return from Canada, her love for entrepreneurship has grown excessively and she is now a budding entrepreneur working on her first business venture. She believes the MEPE fellowship will be very beneficial to her knowledge about entrepreneurship and startups and she is honored to be a MEPE fellow.

              <p class="text-muted large"><a href="http://blackinhistory.tumblr.com/post/61451113376/mary-ellen-pleasant#.WxlEudMvzBJ">Mary Ellen Pleasant</a> was a very successful 19th-century African American entrepreneur, financier, real estate magnate and abolitionist who identified as ‘a capitalist by profession’ in the 1890 United States Census.</p>
              <div style="margin-top:30px"></div>
            
              <p class="text-muted large">Pleasant came from humble beginnings being born into slavery. With her husband, through smart investments and business dealings, she amassed a fortune estimated to be around $30 million dollars. She made active contributions to the abolitionist movement and fought for civil rights in California. She also used her influence and wealth to employ Black Americans, freed and runaway slaves from the underground railroad, at her various businesses.</p>
              <div style="margin-top:30px"></div>
            
              <p class="text-muted large"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ellen_Pleasant">She was a friend</a> and financial supporter of John Brown, and was well known in abolitionist circles. After the Civil War, she took her battles to the courts in the 1860s and won several civil rights victories, one of which was cited and upheld in the 1980s and resulted in her being called &ldquo;The Mother of Human Rights in California&rdquo;.</p>
              <div style="margin-top:30px"></div>
            
              <p class="text-muted large">The MEPE Fellowship embodies her vision, spirit, and desire to help others. With an opportunity to showcase their entrepreneurial talent, fellows can make a significant impact on campus with other students.</p>
